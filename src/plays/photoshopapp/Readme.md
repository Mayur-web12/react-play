## Implementation Details

This code imports a component named PlayHeader from the file common/playlists/PlayHeader. It also imports two custom components, Slider and SidebarItem. It defines an array named DEFAULT_OPTIONS with various image manipulation options. The component uses useState hook to manage the selected option and its value. The handleSliderChange function updates the selected option's value based on the slider change. getImageStyle function generates CSS filters based on the selected options. Finally, the component renders a UI with a main image, a sidebar for options, and a slider.

## Consideration

This code follows the React functional component pattern and utilizes React hooks to manage the state. It is recommended to keep the component structure as simple as possible to prevent performance issues. It also implements a clear and easy-to-understand UI design, making it easier for users to manipulate the image
